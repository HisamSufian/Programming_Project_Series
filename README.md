# 🚀 Python Programming Project

---

## 📁 Overview
Two independent Python projects:
- **Task-1:** Algorithmic Trading Adventure, simulates a simple Golden-Cross Trading Strategy using Python and historical stock data fetched via yfinance. The algorithm automatically buys when a Golden Cross occurs (50-day MA > 200-day MA) and sells when a Death Cross occurs. It starts with a capital and reports the final profit / loss.
- **Task-2:** Samsung Phone Advisor API, An intelligent FastAPI-based service for Samsung phone queries. Uses PostgreSQL for data storage and sentence-transformers for semantic similarity. Supports comparison, specification lookup, best-feature search, and recommendations. Fully tested with sample inputs from the assignment and produces correct structured JSON outputs.

**| # | Project | Domain | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | Algorithmic Trading Adventure | Finance + Data Science | Golden-Cross trading strategy using yfinance & pandas |
| 2 | Samsung Phone Advisor API | AI + Web + NLP | FastAPI service that answers Samsung-related questions intelligently |**
